Temperature and humidity measurement system with on-cloud data storage

This project was made by the following electronics technicians:
  - Gustavo Higuti
  - Ian Aguila
  - Igor de Lucca

The system is composed by 5 parts:
  - An Arduino with a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
  - A computer with the software made
  - A cloud service. (OneDrive is the most recommended one)
  - A .txt file to record the data
  - A dynamic template from PowerBI
